The Pin out for the 130x130 color TFT LCD MSP1601 with the SSD1283A controller sold by makerhawk corresponds to these Arduino pins.

This is NOT an I2C protocol device.

TFT UNO Pin AKA Comment
======= ======= ==== ===================================================
LED A3 Analog PIN for on-module LED Control (if required).
SCK D13 CK,CLK Clock. NOT SCL. That the clock pin SCL (A5) for I2C protocol only.
SDA D11 MOSI Data. Hardware SPI always on the UNO. "SDA" should NEVER be used as a line name in SPI. It is for I2C protocol ONLY.
A0/DC D9 Documentation and source has "CD" which is INCORRECT. Board has "A0/DC" - "A0" is a total mystery.
RST D8 Reset
CS D10 SS Chip select. SS is strictly an SPI line name.
GND GND Power supply ground (negative)
VCC 5V +5V power supply in

N/A D12 MISO Unused apparently

The source code and documentation references most pins without a digital/analog prefix. For example, they use "13" instead of "D13". Highly annoying and confusing.
